# 05_menu_stub

This stub is a component that renders the menu items of a mock restaurant. The menu data is fetched from an external API which I created using Netlify. This component has dynamically loaded filter buttons that can be used to filter
the menu items based on the category to which the items belong. The filter being applied is highlighted to make it easier to identify.
